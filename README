This collection of files is run off of main.py on a pico and controlled using vacuumGUI.py on a PC.

main.py:  manages the robots driving, arm, vacuum, and MQTT communications.
          directly utililizes the following libraries:
              ArmDrive.py
              CarDrive.py
              MQTT.py

ArmDrive.py:  controls the arm using servo outputs
          directly utilizes the following libraries:
              Giotto.py
              Servo.py

ArmDrive.py:  controls the car using servo outputs
          directly utilizes the following libraries:
              Servo.py

vacuumGUI.py:  manages the GUI on PC and gets input from PS4 controller
          directly utilizes the following libraries:
              PS4Controller.py
              Paho-MQTT

Giotto.py:  determines necessary angles of the arm for a given 2D position

Servo.py: initiates Servos and determines necessary duty cycle for given position / speed

PS4Controller.py: imports control inputs from PS4 controller over USB connection
